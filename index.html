                <h2>Turning Imagination into Reality</h2>
                <p>
                    From a young age, I’ve always had a knack for bringing my imagination to life. My journey began when I was just 
                    <strong>13 or 14</strong>, sketching my first website with nothing but <strong>pen and paper</strong>—a simple idea that would later evolve into something much bigger.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As I grew, my curiosity expanded beyond web development. I delved into <strong>multimedia arts</strong>, exploring <strong>photography, photo editing, and illustration</strong>, where I found another creative outlet. 
                    By the time I reached senior high school, I pursued <strong>Mobile and Web Development (MAWD)</strong>, spending <strong>two years</strong> mastering the craft and deepening my technical skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At <strong>18</strong>, I developed my <strong>first Java application</strong>, a milestone made possible when I finally got my first laptop. This opened up a new world of possibilities, pushing me to explore even further.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In College, I chose to major in <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, driven by a personal need to understand <strong>digital security</strong> due to past experiences. The more I learned, the more I realized how vital security is in the tech world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, my passion for development continues to grow. I’m actively expanding my expertise in different programming languages, with a particular focus on <strong>Go</strong>—a language that fascinates me with its 
                    <strong>efficiency, scalability, and raw performance</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>My journey is far from over. I’m constantly learning, improving, and building—one project at a time.</p>
